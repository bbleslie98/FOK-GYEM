/**
 * @brief Configures the energization time for each coil, in microseconds. Default value is 1000 us = 1 ms, from specification.
 * Drastic write speed increase can be achieved using this. The value should determined experimentally, and it depends
 * on the screen position. Eg. using the screen horizontally requires less magnetic energization than using vertically.
 * 
 * Reference values: A good condition vertical screen works well with 400 us write time. For a horizontal one I was able
 * to decrease the value to 300 us. 
 *
 * 								!!!DANGER!!!
 * Increasing this value over 1000 us might cause overcurrent in the driver IC's or overheating the
 * windings which might destroy them.
